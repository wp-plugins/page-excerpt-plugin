== Description ==
The Page Excerpt Plugin enables you to add an optional hand-crafted summary of your pages content to each page that can be used in your theme or by plugins.

= Requirements =

= Questions =
If you have any questions feel free to leave a comment in my blog. But please think about this: I will not add features, write customizations or write tutorials for free. Please think about a donation. I'm a human and to write code is hard work.

= Language =
This Plugin uses core translation strings only. So if you use WordPress in your language this plugin will use the same translations. You do not need any language file.
